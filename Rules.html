        <h1>How to play sequencium</h1>
        <p>The sequencium board is a 6 by 6 board. Each square can be
            either blue, red, or neutral. On blue's turn, blue 
            can click a neutral square adjacent to a blue square.
            The neutral square will become blue, and filled in with 
            the highest number of its neighboring squares, plus one.
            Else, blue can pass. Red moves similarly. At the end
            of the game, the color with the highest number wins (ties
            are allowed).
