        <h1>Technical Stuff</h1>
        <h2>Why is the starting position different?</h2>
        <p>It is not that hard to see that first move is a significant
            advantage in Sequencium. It might also not be that hard to see
            that the second player can nullify this advantage by mirroring
            the first player's moves, guaranteeing a draw. So, instead, what
            you see is my personal adjustment, which I believe makes the 
            game more more interesting and balanced.

        <h2>How to play Sequencium well?</h2>
        <p>
            Prioritize both making a high number, and preventing the opponent
            from reaching one. One of the most basic strategies is to build a 
            "wall" that the opponent cannot infiltrate. A wall can also have
            the purpose of restricting the opponent's growth. It will also
            be helpful to learn how to "read" a position, i.e. estimate
            how big each side should be able to get. Ultimately,
            sequencium about balancing offense with defense.

        <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
        <p>
            The AI runs a modified <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search>MCTS</a>
            algorithm. It uses smarter random playouts, in which it attempts
            to build from the highest number if possible, and otherwise pulls
            a random move. It also combines the result of the random playouts
            with a heuristic that attempts to estimate territorial control.
            This should result in an AI that is strategically decent, while
            retaining good tactical vision. However, the bot will still
            occasionally misread complicated positions where both sides are invading
            and defending at the same time.
            It is not recommended to call the bot if less than 5 squares
            remain unfilled, due to a bug affecting how it handles
            terminal positions during search (and you should be able to read such a position).
